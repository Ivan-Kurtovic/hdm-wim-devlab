Let's talk about current activities concerning the HighNet project. Ok. Shall we look at the tasks leading to the milestone ahead? Sure. We have been working on network issues for the diagnosis module. It is item 3 on the task list. I think, we will come up with something viable shortly. That sounds great. What about expenses? Do you think, you will be able to stay within the limits we aggreed upon last week? That should be no problem. I'll leave a detailed report on Google drive. Ok, thanks. Let's make an appointment for our next meeting. Let me check my calendar. How about next Thursday at 16 hours your time? Perfect. See you then. Bye. Have a nice day. Bye.
